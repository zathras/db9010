<h2>Database Entry Point</h2>

The <code>Database</code> class first lets you establish a connection
to a JDBC driver.  It then provides support to create and drop tables, 
and create various kinds of statements.  It also manages statement
caches, so each unique statement need only be prepared once.  A typical
usage is shown in the <a href="../index.html">introductions</a>:
<pre>
        db.select(People.columns).from(People) + 
                "WHERE " + People.name + " &lt;> " + param run { query ->
            ...
        }
</pre>
The call to <code>db.select(...)</code> yields an instance of
<code>SelectQuery.Builder</code>.  This object has a 
<code>From(Table)</code> method that returns the same builder.
The builder also defines the <code>+</code> operator for appropriate
types, allowing a full statement to be build up.  Finally, the
infix <code>run</code> operator is applied to the builder.
<p>
The <code>run</code> operator takes a lambda that accepts a
<code>SelectQuery</code>.  See the 
<a href="statements_uml.html">statements description</a> for what happens next.
<p>
The other statement types work similarly.  There are some differences, though.
For example, an <code>INSERT</code> statement never has a <code>WHERE</code>
clause, or other functionality that would require it to accept text or
parameters.
<code>Update</code> is a little special, in that each column sent to the
</code>Builder</code> will result in a value that needs to be provided
in the 
<a href="statements_uml.html">next step</a>; 
for the other statement types, it is only
<code>Parameter</code> objects that generate a need to supply a value.
