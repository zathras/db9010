When the client code is finished using a <code>Builder</code>, it calls
<code>run(lambda)</code> on the builder to run the statement.  This tells
the builder to build the statement, prepare it, and then call the body
of the lambda.
With the exception of <code>InsertStatement</code>, statements take
values for their <code>Parameter</code>s.  Client code does this with
the <code>ParameterSetter.set(Parameter, T)</code> method.  When the 
client code is finished setting parameters, the statement is then 
executed.  For all but the <code>SelectQuery</code>, this happens 
when the user's code block finishes.
<p>
In the case of the <code>SelectQuery</code>, executing the statement is
triggered by asking for the first results, with <code>next()</code>, or,
when the client is certain there will be a result row, 
<code>nextOrFail()</code>.  Once that is done, it is illegal to continue
to set parameters, and an attempt to do so generates an
<code>IllegalStateException</code>.  After the query is run, it becomes
legal to get table values, using <code>get(TableColumn)</code>.  If the
select statement is <code>forUpdate()</code>, row values can be set
with <code>set(TableColumn, T)</code> method, and the updates can
be written to the database with <code>update()</code>.
<p>
<code>InsertStatement</code> and <code>UpdateStatement</code> objects'
builders take a code block that's used to establish which columns appear
in the statment, and to provide them values.  Both builders have a
method called 
</code>run</code>. When it completes, the statement is built,
prepared and executed.  

<code>InsertStatement</code> offers a different alternative, however.
An insert statement can produce a <code>ResultSet</code>, containing
the value(s) of the primary key/keys.  For this reason, there are two
variants of the 
<a href="main_uml.html"><code>Database</code></a>
method <code>insertInto</code>:
<pre>
    db.insertInto(MyTable) <strong>run</strong> { row -> 
        row[MyTable.myStringColumn] = "x" 
        row[MyTable.myIntColumn] = 42
   }
</pre>
and
<pre>

    val id : Int = db.insertInto(MyTable) { row -> 
        row[MyTable.myStringColumn] = "x" 
        row[MyTable.myIntColumn] = 42
    } <strong>run</strong> { result -> 
        row[MyTable.thePrimaryKey]
    }
</pre>
<p>
In the first variant, the <code>Database.insertInto(Table)</code>
method actually produces an <code>InsertStatement.BuilderNoResults</code>,
so named because the client code isn't asking for results.  Then,
the user invokes the infix <code>run</code> method with a body to
set the rows.  The <code>BuilderNoResults</code> internally creates a
<code>Builder</code>, and provides that builder with a body
that discards the results.
<p>
In the second variant, the client is invoking the method
<code>Database.insertInto(Table, lambda)</code> method.  This
directly creates an <code>InsertStatement.Builder</code>, which
has a <code>run</code> method.  This builder's <code>run</code> method is
executed <i>after</i> the insert statement is run, and is given an
<code>InsertStatement.Result</code> object wrapping 
the <code>ResultSet</code>, so that the client can query for the
values of the primary key(s).
<p>
This implementation of <code>InsertStatement</code> is a little
subtle, but it's hopefully intuitive for clients.  The rule is simple:
With all statments, you <strong>always</strong> call the infix
</code>run</code> method.  It's just that with insert statement, you can
call <code>run</code> after the code block that sets the values, so you can
provide a second code block to get the results of the insert.
